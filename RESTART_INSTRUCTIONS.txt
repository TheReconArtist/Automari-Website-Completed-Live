🚨 CRITICAL: RESTART YOUR SERVER NOW

The chatbot is fixed but you MUST restart the server for changes to take effect:

STEP 1: Stop the current server
- In Terminal, press: Ctrl + C
- (You might need to press it twice)

STEP 2: Start it again
- In Terminal, paste this:
cd /Users/theoasis/automari-website/automari-website-1 && npm run dev

STEP 3: Wait 20 seconds
- You'll see: ✓ Ready on http://localhost:3000

STEP 4: Refresh your browser
- Go to: http://localhost:3000
- Click the chat button
- Try asking: "I need help with email management"
- It should now use OpenAI and know ALL 10 agents!

✅ Chatbot now properly detects OpenAI API
✅ System prompt updated with ALL 10 Automari agents
✅ Each agent has specific capabilities, ROI, and success stories
