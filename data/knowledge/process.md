# Automari Onboarding Process

Our onboarding process is designed to be seamless and high-impact, ensuring you quickly realize the benefits of AI automation. Here's a typical breakdown:

1.  **Discovery & Strategy Call:** A personalized consultation with our team to deeply understand your business, identify key pain points, and define automation opportunities. We'll map out your current workflows and desired outcomes.
2.  **Solution Design & Proposal:** Based on our discovery, we design a tailored AI automation solution, outlining the agents, integrations, and expected ROI. You'll receive a comprehensive proposal.
3.  **Implementation & Integration:** Our expert team deploys the AI agents, integrating them seamlessly with your existing systems (CRM, ERP, email platforms, etc.). We handle all the technical heavy lifting.
4.  **Training & Handoff:** We ensure your team is fully equipped to leverage the new automation. While our agents work autonomously, we provide training for any necessary oversight or interaction.
5.  **Optimization & Support:** Post-launch, we continuously monitor performance, provide ongoing support, and iterate on the solutions to maximize efficiency and adapt to your evolving business needs.
